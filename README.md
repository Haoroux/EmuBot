# EmuBot v1.1

What is Emubot ?
-
Emubot is a discord robot that emulates keys on a pc based on what it reads on discord. This allows the user to play or do various actions through the discord iterm√©diaire.

He has a lot of differents commands that allow a lot of customisations:

-help : show how to make actions

-amountofanswers : define the numbers of answers to make an average to know what to play

-info : shows the actual settings of the bot

-managerole : defines the role to change the settings of the bot(need a restart)

-managechannel : changes the channel where the bot reads the informations

-managecontrols : changes the words to write to make an action

-usertotalactions : shows the number of actions made by a user or oneself

-usertop10 : shows a top 10 of the most active players

-restart : restarts and saves the data of the bot

How to use it ?
-
First, you need to know the fact that the bot only reads the chat and emulates keyboard keys and does not stream or launch a game !!!!  
So you have to on the same pc run the game, the bot and a discord account in order to stream the game.  
Second, this python program use different librairies. You need to install them if you want to use the bot.  
Third, **do not forget to set the settings of the bot**

Important
-
The bot is currently in french because of me.
It is only the 1.1 version of the bot. It must and will have bugs and ways to improve it. I am actively improving it!! If you have any special requests just post a comment or reach me via discord (Haoroux).
